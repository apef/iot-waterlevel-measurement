# iot-waterlevel-measurement

Project members: Simon Mira Engstr√∂m, Andreas Axelsson

A project aimed at creating an IoT solution that will measure the water level in stormdrains. 

By measuring the water level in storm drains, it would be possible to:

* Know if the storm drains are not being drained correctly, which might indicate blockage.
* Make an overview over a series of connected stormdrains and be able to find out if there is a leak in the piping between stormdrains.
* Being able to see how the water level looks like on each day and storing it could provide useful data.

## Hardware
### Microcontroller (MCU)
This project uses a DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 board, which has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth intergrated.

### Sensors
This project uses the folowing two sensors
* Distance measuring: A02YYUW - Waterproof ultrasonic sensor
* Temperature and humidity measuring: DHT11

### LoRaWAN
This project uses a LoRaWAN Unit 868MHz from M5stack for LoRa connetion.

### Battery
This project uses a regular Power Bank for powering the components which connects trhough the microcontrollers micro USB port. But it is posible to use for example a Lipo battery and measure its battery level though the GPIO32 pin on the ESP32 board, were there is a battery level measure implemented in our code for that pin.

## Software
### TOIT Framework
The TOIT framework allows for remote flashing an ESP32 device, this means that the device that will be installed inside of stormdrains do not have to be removed from its location in order to update it via a serial connection.

### Software setup
#### TOIT
1. Install TOIT by downloading it from https://toitlang.org/
2. Connect the Microcontroller via USB and enter the command "jag flash" in your terminal/commandline
3. Insert the name of your WiFi-network and the password. The device will then be connected to WiFi and you can then upload TOIT applications wirelessly.
